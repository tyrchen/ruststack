//! Stream emitter trait and change event types for DynamoDB Streams integration.
//!
//! DynamoDB core calls [`StreamEmitter::emit`] after each successful write
//! operation to capture change data for DynamoDB Streams. The trait is defined
//! here (in `rustack-dynamodb-core`) and implemented in
//! `rustack-dynamodbstreams-core` to follow the dependency inversion
//! principle.
